    <h1>Zharia Montgomery Venters' MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>I enjoy exploring all kinds of creativity because they encompass many mediums that allow me to tell a story. Being a black queer woman from the south, I've rarely seen my pespective and life represented in the media. Experiencing this has since inspired me to create thought provoking art. To express that people who look like me are not a monolith. Most importantly, to illustrate the importance of representation. </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>The beginning of starting this portfolio was pretty easy. For me the most difficult part has been trying to add the image and trying to avoid the code from failing. At the time of writing this I've already had to do 11 commits.</p>
