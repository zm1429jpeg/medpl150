    <h1>Zharia Montgomery Venters' MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>I enjoy exploring all kinds of creativity because they encompass many mediums that allow me to tell a story. However, what I enjoy most is photography and graphic design. Being a black queer woman from the south, I've rarely seen my perspective and life represented in the media. Experiencing this has since inspired me to create thought provoking art through a lens and computer. For me, in order to do this my goal is almost always to express that people who look like me are not a monolith. To capture people like me in their most raw, beautiful, and vulnerable states. And most importantly, to stress the importance of representation in the media. </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>The beginning of starting this portfolio was pretty easy. For me the most difficult part has been trying to add the image and trying to avoid the code from failing. At the time of writing this I've already had to do 11 commits.</p>
